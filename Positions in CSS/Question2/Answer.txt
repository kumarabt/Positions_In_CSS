The main diffrence between in absolute and relative positing is that:

1. When you make any element in a dom position relative it can now be relatively positioned now w.r.t. its
orignal position in webpage but when we make an element position absolute it bydefault gets placed at 
(0,0) i.e. wrt top left position of its parent and if parent is not mentioned it places at (0,0) w.r.t 
body/root.

2. Relative positining element on giving attributes like left, right, top and bottom doesn't impact their
siblings and shift their position in ***same layer*** in webpage.
NOTE: since the place in browser where you render is w.r.t. your siblings and using position 
             relative only when you use top, left, right, bottom will not impact the relative position of 
             your sibling but any other dimension like margin, padding, width,height  etc. will impact 
             the position of your sibling.

But, that is not the case with absolute positing as the elements here are in***diffrent layers*** 
according to their z-index and they also doesnt affect anything on main layer while shifting their position.

3. Absolute element shifts w.r.t. nearest relative parent that means the nearest parent should be marked
position: relative if we want the Absolute element to shift w.r.t to it.
